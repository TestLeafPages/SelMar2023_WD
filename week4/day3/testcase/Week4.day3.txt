Today's Agenda:
==============
   1)9:30-10:10->TestNG Introduction
   2)10:10-10:30->ClassRoom
   3)10:30-10:55->Sequential Execution
   4)10:55:11:30->Classroom+ Break
   5)11:30-11:50->Parallel Execution
   6)11:50-12:05->Classroom
   7)12:05-12:35->String


   TestNG-- Test Execution Framework
   --support only java programming language
   
   TestNG---Test NEXT GENERATION
   --comb of Junit and Nunit
   --cedric
   --Junit
   
   why we going to framework?

Limitations:
===========
   1)One by One  
       -Time Consuming 
       -Same data
       -Manually someone have to be present
     Requirement:
        -Run automatedly-Sequential,Parallel

   2)Run for hardcoded data 
       Requirement: 
        -run for different data
   
   3)There is no reporting
      Requirement:
        -Atleast basic reporting (passes,failed,skipped)
		s
   4)There is no way to filter the tests to run 
     Requirement:
        -Group the desired testcases 

   5)There is no way to rerun the failed testcases 
     Requirement:
        Automated retry
		




 Steps to run as TestNG:
 ======================
    1)Convert the main method to a normal method
	   -remove static
	   -remove arguments
	2)Give a meaningful name to your method
	
	3)Add @Test at the top of the method and import it
	
	4)Run as TestNG
