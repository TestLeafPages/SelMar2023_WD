 what is primitive datatypes:
 A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.
 
 we have 8 primitive datatype
 
 1. INT
 2. SHORT
 3. FLOAT
 4. BOOLEAN
 5. CHAR
 6. DOUBLE
 7. LONG
 8. BYTE
 
 only 4- int,float,char,boolean
 
 INT(no decimals)- age-25
 
 FLOAT-FD rate-6.5f or F
 
 char--'d'/'@'/'8'/'W'
 'dh'--it will  not take
 
 boolean-yes/no--true/false
 
 short,long ,int
 
 double-10/3=3.3333333
 
 byte-2
 
 long- 1234568907l or L



CONTROL STATEMENTS:

*Loop
*Conditional statement

Loop:

repeat the same logic  to run multiples

doing same thing again and again

two types:
for loop----whenever you know how many times you need to loop it.
10 times

while loop---when you do not know how many times we need to loop it, as it based on condition.


Conditional statement:
if-else

if---when condition is true it will print output

else-- when condition get false it  will print out

nested if ---inside the if

//syntax
		if() {
			
		}else {
			
		}
