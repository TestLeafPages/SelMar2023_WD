Set:
-Interface -It cannot hold duplicate data/only Unique

Implementation class:
Hash set----ra ndom order
LinkHash set---insertion order
Tree set---ascii values
Method of set:
1) size()-> Number of items in the set
2) add()->  to add the data in a set
3) remove() -> to remove the data / element
4) get() - > this method is not available  because of the implementation class(index differs)
5) Collections.sort()-->it will not happen(Tree set)


list{1,4,7,7,8,5,9,3,67,867,89} --get(10)-0-10
//duplicate will not allow
{1,4,7,7,8,5,9,3,67,867,89,89}--get 8-get(4)

set{1,4,7,8,5,9,3,67,867,89}---0-9--get(3)
7-details
7-dis
get(9)


set{1,4,7,8,5,9,3,67,867,89}---0-9--get(3)

set() convert into list then i can use get()

classroom 1: Remove Duplicates: int[] num={3,5,7,2,5,7,9,2,1,54,8,4,6,4,8} 
i.declear a set
ii. hint (i need random order)
iii.Iterate through a loop and add data 
iv.print values output will be.{3,5,7,2,9,1,54,8,4,6}

Classroom 2: Print only unique characters in the given string
 String companyName = "google" --> "gole" 
 Hints: convert to chararray Use Set with add method.


 Keywords:
 static
 final
 this
 super

static keyword:
static-it will stored inthe Stack memory

two-
1.static
2.non static


The static keyword can be used as a 
static variable, static method, static block, and static class. 
1.static keyword with variable it is called static variable

Syntax to declare the static variables:

static dataType variableName = value;

2. Static method in Java

You can declare a static method by using of static keyword.

1. Static methods are belonging to a class.
2. You can access a static method by using the class name. You do not have the need to create an object.
3. A static method can access only static variables. If you write any non-static variable in a static method,
then it will throw an exception at compilation time.
syntax:
access_modifier static return_Type method_Name()
{
    // body of method
}




final 
-----
its a keyword used to apply some restriction to the user
cvv-123

final can applied to classes,method,variable

1.final variable-constant you cannot changes the value
2.final method-you cannot override the final method
3.final class-you cannot extends the final class



 this Keyword:
---refer current class method
---used for constructor chaining
---pass arg in method can use this
---return current class instance
this-->return same class object 

Super--> The super keyword in java comes in a role with the concept of inheritance.
the super keyword refers to the object of an immediate parent class. It means the 
super keyword uses in subclasses to access the object of the superclass.
variable, constructor, and method of a superclass by using the super keyword. 
1. Java super keyword can access the variable of the parent class  
2. Java super keyword can invoke the constructor of the parent class
3. Java super keyword can access the method of the parent class
