Abstraction:
Abstraction means hiding the complexity and only showing the essential
feature of the object.

Hiding implementation details and showing functionality to the user.

eg:mobile,ATM

1nterface-----100% unimplementation

2.Abstract class----both implementation & unimplementation

3.Concrete class----full implementation
.I
class --- interface====implements
 

how we can acheive the abstraction:
we have two ways
1. interface---- desgin document

like buleprint or desgin paper
its 100% unimplementation
its should not body(code) only we can have only method.

keyword-- implements

2. abstract class---
its partial Implementation
we have both implementation and unimplementation method.

A class that is declared with an abstract keyword is known as an abstract class. 
An abstract class can have abstract methods (methods without the body) 
and concrete/non-abstract methods (Methods with the body) also.

keywords:

class to class ----extends 
class to interface ---- implements
abstract class to class ---- extends
interface  to interface ----extends   











Collection:
==========

collection -- its a interface

 the main difference between Collection and Collections in Java is that 
 --Collection is an interface that defines a group of elements and their operations,
 --Collections is a class that provides utility methods for working with collections.

-Dynami Array(size can grow or shrink)
-Automated increment / decrement
-collection can only hold claseses(no primitive data types)

two types:
=========

*list

*set
---------------------------------------------------------------------
List--list is a child interface of collection.
it is an ordered collection of object in which duplicate values can be stored.
list maintain the insertion order.

Arraylist: its based on index values

Linkedlist: its based on node values

properties:
* list allow duplicates
* list maintains the insertion order

ArrayList:  An ArrayList class is a resizable array, which is present in the 
java. util package. While built-in arrays have a fixed size, 
ArrayLists can change their size dynamically. Elements can be added and 
removed from an ArrayList whenever there is a need.


syntax:
int,float.char
<Integer>,<Float><>
List<wapper class> objectname= new ArrayList<wapper class>();
List<Integer>
<>------ generic to restric the datatype

what is wapper class?

Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field,
we can store primitive data types. In other words, we can wrap a primitive value 
into a wrapper class object.

Method:
1.add()-

2.remove()-

3.size()-

4.IsEmpty()-

5.contains()-

6.clear()-

7.get()-
